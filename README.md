# Bar&Tapas
Django Webpage about Bars and Tapas, based on next tutorial:
[TangoWithDjango](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/)

To not use static content by myself when deploying, I did the following tutorial: [Django-assets](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets)

You can see the final result here in [Heroku](http://baresytapas.herokuapp.com/)

##Problems
I don't know why but highcharts node doesn't load if I use https conection. Fixing it in next version.
